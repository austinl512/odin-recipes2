# odin-recipes2
For this project, I had to create a main index page that hosts relative links to three food recipe pages. 

Each recipe page contains:
- An image of the dish; a description of the dish
- The nutrition facts per serving
- The ingredients required to make the dish
- The steps that must be followed to make the dish

To create the Odin recipe pages I had to use the following:
- Anchor elements
- Paragraph elements
- Header elements
- Unordered/ordered list elements
- List item elements
- Image embed elements

Furthermore, I was able to practice basic Git commands and writing commit messages.
