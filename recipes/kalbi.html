        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kalbi is a grilled dish in Korean cuisine that is made with marinated beef (or pork) short ribs in a ganjang-based sauce (Korean soy sauce).</p>
        <p>Kalbi is a staple of Korean fine dining but is too expensive in restaurants. It is simple to make at home and will leave your guests asking for more. Total time includes marinating time. It's 
            traditionally served sliced, rolled in romaine lettuce leaves with white rice, lightly browned garlic slices, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).</p>
