        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kalbi is a grilled dish in Korean cuisine that is made with marinated beef (or pork) short ribs in a ganjang-based sauce (Korean soy sauce).</p>

            traditionally served sliced, rolled in romaine lettuce leaves with white rice, lightly browned garlic slices, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).</p>
