        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Teriyaki chicken is simply chicken that is coated in teriyaki sauce.</p>
        <p>The dish comes from the Japanese cooking technique called teriyaki, where meat is grilled or broiled with a soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze. Today, teriyaki chicken refers to any 
            chicken with teriyaki sauce â€” regardless of the cooking method. Traditional teriyaki sauce is made up of four ingredients: soy sauce, mirin, ginger, and sugar. But many chefs have their 
            own takes on teriyaki sauce. In this recipe, the teriyaki sauce includes soy sauce, sugar, ginger, cornstarch (for thickening), cider vinegar (instead of mirin), water, garlic, and black 
            pepper.</p>
