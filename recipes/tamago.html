        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tamago (a.k.a. tamagoyaki) is a Japanese omelet. Itâ€™s made by rolling together thin layers of fried eggs, then slicing the log into rectangles. Since the egg is mixed with dashi, sugar, and 
            mirin, the finished product has a complex and subtly sweet flavor. Tamago is traditionally served for breakfast or as a sushi ingredient. You can enjoy the homemade tamago right away or 
            freeze it for up to two weeks. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. </p>
